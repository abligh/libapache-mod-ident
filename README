mod_ident2 - provide rfc1413 ident to apache2

/*
 * mod_ident2: Handle RFC 1413 ident request
 * obtained from rfc1413.c
 *
 * rfc1413() speaks a common subset of the RFC 1413, AUTH, TAP and IDENT
 * protocols. The code queries an RFC 1413 etc. compatible daemon on a remote
 * host to look up the owner of a connection. The information should not be
 * used for authentication purposes. This routine intercepts alarm signals.
